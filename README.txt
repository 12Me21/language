just compile main.c all the other things are #included and you don't need to link anything because I'm bad

read demo.prg

The WASM release will always be slightly outdated because I don't have the compiler installed on my main computer and it takes like an hour.

P.S. most of the comments are just ideas or notes to myself, not actual descriptions of the code...
